Design and implement a chat system that allows multiple groups of users to chat. A chat
coordinator resides at a well-known network address, uses UDP for communication with
chat clients, sets up chat servers for each chat session, and maintains a chat session
directory. There is one chat server per chat session. A chat server uses TCP for
communication with clients. A chat client allows users to start, join, and leave a chat
session. Design and implement the coordinator, server, and client code.
